Biocaust Modpack

Theme:
You wake up in your cryosleep chamber to the sound of an alarm blaring. Emergency lights faintly illuminate the cold underground vault you went to sleep in ages ago.

Something's not right - you were supposed to hibernate for 100 years, at which time it was believed the world would have recovered from the Last War. Checking the computer, it has only been 65 years. Toxin scrubbers are failing, water reserves are low, and power levels are critical. It won't be long before the vault is uninhabitable. You have no choice but to grab your survival gear, open the main vault doors, and venture outside.

The world before you is a toxic hellscape - a land of vast ruined cities, mutated creatures, and untamed wildlands. You need to find food and water, figure out how to repair and power the scrubbers and life support systems, and either find a way to survive and thrive in this world long-term, or find a way off the planet.

Mods:
* Lost Cities
* Terralith
* True Darkness (torches burn up)
* Starter Structure (you start in a vault)
* Distant Horizons (lets you see a long ways in the distance)
* Vic's Point Blank Guns (find-only for guns, can craft basic ammo)
* Immersive Engineering (electricity production)
* Tinker's Construct
* Epic Siege Mod?
* Enemy hideouts spawn in the world, and these enemies use guns?
* Quests/objectives that reward guns, parts, ammo, seeds, NPCs, etc.
* The mod that makes you have to dry leather, etc. Through the ages? Some kind of slower progression mod.
* Mob spawn blockers, BUT they need to be powered to work. Maybe make the wave mob spawns attack them?
* Look at primitive or horror or wasteland mods.
* Land mines, which make enemy outposts difficult to assault. Gotta make sure the player can't cheese these too much by aggroing mobs and leading them into their own landmines (stupid AI). The landmine mod should make the player immune to mines they (and other players) plant, and therefore we can also set the enemy mobs to be immune to the landmines at their bases.
* Something that adds destroyed mechs to the landscape. These mech parts can be salvaged for resources.
* Salt Craft mod or similar, to add salt and pink salt blocks to the dried up oceans.

Challenges:
* Lighting (darkness is pitch black, torches burn out, most permanent/free light sources removed)
* Wood (forests and jungles have been replaced with arid scrublands and deserts, making wood a more scarce resource)
* Water (sea level has been drastically lowered, removing water from most rivers and oceans)

Advantages:
* You start in a safe bunker with advanced starting gear.
* You can see a long ways in the distance. (Distant Horizons mod)

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Ocean Monuments have been removed from the world, so I need to provide another source for Sponge, since according to the docs, Sponges are only found in Ocean Monuments.
